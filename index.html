            <h2>Tech I work with:</h2>
            Java has been that language that will stick with me for life because it helped me understand the fundamentals of OOP and the functionality that one can implement as a programmer.<br>
            I find JavaScript very versatile and easy to implement for web development like I have done right now with github pages and its very easy to work with its frameworks.<br>
            MongoDB and SQL have been good tools to understand data management and helped me connect my projects to create full stack applications.<br>
